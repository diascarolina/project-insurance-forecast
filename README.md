# 1 Problem Context

Today, as prices rise and rise for basic necessities, we need to have a way to check beforehand what we will spend our money on. For medical insurance we can take a look at various features to arrive at a price for customers. This is what we'll do in this project, from prediction to deployment.

Our data was obtained from this [Kaggle problem on Medical Cost - Insurance Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance), in which we have the question of **"Can you accurately predict insurance costs?"**

> For ease of access, the data was upload to GitHub [here](https://github.com/diascarolina/project-insurance-forecast/blob/main/insurance.csv).

From this we see that we have the following information (adapted from the Kaggle problem description):

|  Column  |             Description             |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|    **age**   |  Age of primary beneficiary  |
|    **sex**   |  Insurance contractor gender: female, male |
|    **bmi**   |  Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight $(kg/m^2)$ using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 |
|   **children**   | Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents |
| **smoker** |    If that person smokes or not    |
| **region** |  The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest  |
|  **charges**  |  Individual medical costs billed by health insurance  |


The variable we want to predict is from the column **charges**
