# Health Insurance Price Forecast

Welcome! In this project, we used linear regression to predict how much someone would pay in insurance using some variables related to personal information, such as age and gender.

ðŸŸ¢ You can make a POST request to the URL https://insurance-forecast.herokuapp.com/predict/ using the following _json_ as an example:

```
    {
        "age": 19,
        "sex": "female",
        "bmi": 25,
        "children": 1,
        "smoker": "no",
        "region": "northwest"
    }
```

ðŸŸ¢ You can also [click here](https://share.streamlit.io/diascarolina/project-insurance-forecast/main) to check out the Streamlit App, in which you can also predict the insurance price, but in a nicer way ðŸ˜‰
